# Portfolio
I'm pursuing higher education in France. I'm majoring in web and software development, as well as programming and network administration. So I came up with the idea of ​​creating an online portfolio to showcase my skills.

As a beginner in web development,
Almost all of this code was created by AI.

I'm currently learning to read #HTML and #CSS code, but I'm not at all capable of creating all of it myself.
